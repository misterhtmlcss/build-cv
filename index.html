        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For the past 20 years I've been a marketing professional that has worked with to near exclusivity all digital projects. I've built web pages in 1999 and written on blogger.com in 2004 and had many now famous and somewhat iconic people comment on a technology blog while I was in London, UK.</p>
        <p>Since all that I've moved back to Calgary, Alberta where I was born and while hear I've become more and more interested in software development, particularly web development. Having only been able to produce basic HTML and CSS for 20 year, I'm definitely starting flat footed, but I believe my constant exposure will help me in the long run.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creative Connexions: This was a unique project that I was the project lead on that was part of a massive and international effort by the UK government to export UK creativity.</li>
                <li>Jayman Homes: I produced a 6 month campaign that was considered the most engaging social media project to that date</li>
                <li>Twestival: I helped found a massive social movement called Twestival in Alberta, connecting the organizers I knew from the UK with smart people in my sister city Edmonton and organizing the event here in Calgary for them.</li>
                <li>West17Media: My own agency; this was my last stand as an independent and focused digital marketer, it was here that I decided I needed a change and eventually that change become my learnning to write software. Wish me luck!!</li>
